![Test](/docs/banner.svg)

An Airtable Extension with several customization options including permission, design, and functional settings that allows one to trigger a webhook, make an API call, or send data to another application by the simple press of a button.

This extension shines in its customizability. Settings are self-documented and provide a range of use cases. Want to have a manual trigger for an automation? Go ahead! Want to run a Zap for Zapier integration? This automation makes it possible. Want to export data to another application? Input your webhook options and you are ready to go.
